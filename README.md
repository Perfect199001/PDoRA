# PDoRA:A New Low-Rank Adaptation Method for Brain Structure and Metastasis Segmentation via Decoupled Principal Weight Direction and Magnitude

 we propose PDoRA, an innovative parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that leverages knowledge transfer from a pre-trained SwinUNETR model for a wide range of brain image segmentation tasks.
